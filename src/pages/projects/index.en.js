        <p>In the website, the user can check next matches, current competitions, team members and news articles.</p>
        <p>The website is built on <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> and all content is managed through <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful CMS</a>. Everytime new articles are created or updated, a pipeline is triggered to compile the pages and redeploy the website.</p>
